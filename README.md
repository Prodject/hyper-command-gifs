# Hyper Command Gifs

Plugin for Hyperâ„¢ terminal.

Enhances your daily terminal routine with gifs. Because why not.

Currently the plugin only matches for `push` (e.g. `git push`), but more are soon to follow.

The plugin calls the Giphy API when a keyword is matched at the moment. Probably gonna switch to a curated list in the future since the not all commands work as well as `push`.
