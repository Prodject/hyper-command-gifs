# Hyper Command Gifs

Plugin for Hyperâ„¢ terminal.

Enhances your daily terminal routine with gifs. Because why not.

Currently the plugin only matches for "push" (e.g. `git push`), but more are soon to follow. It probably will be a curated gif list in the future instead of a Giphy query for the command.

## How to use

Install [Hyper](https://hyper.is) and add `hyper-command-gifs`
to `plugins` in `~/.hyper.js`.

```javascript
plugins: [
  'hyper-command-gifs'
]
```
